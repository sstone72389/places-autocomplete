# places-autocomplete

This repository is a working example of using the google maps API to autocomplete adresses. This could be implemented in the checkout section of an e-commerce site.

Please note the following:

* The script must be loaded asychronously to ensure callback works.
* This is using NO api key for security purposes. Key will need to be added to ensure functionality remains

Enjoy

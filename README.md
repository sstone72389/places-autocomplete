# places-autocomplete

This repository is a working example of using the google maps API to autocomplete addresses. This could be implemented in the checkout section of an e-commerce site.

Please note the following:

* The script must be deferred to ensure callback works.
* This is utilizing bootstrap solely for the demo's purposes

Enjoy

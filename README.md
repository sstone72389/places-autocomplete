# places-autocomplete

This repository is a working example of using the google maps API to autocomplete adresses. This could be implemented in the checkout section of an e-commerce site.

Please note the following:

*The script must be loaded asychronously to ensure callback works.
*API key is my own and may need to be updated to ensure proper functionality

Enjoy
